    "Not the end of the world. From here, I could just filter the list to get the speaker names and dates separately. Inspired by the code that Oliver Gregory shared in the `#help-python-pandas` channel on Slack, I could do something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "        dates.append(info[i])\n",

    "As you will eventually learn, XPath lets you capture the text inside the `<p>` tag and separate the speaker names and dates in one go. All we need to do is to specify the position of the text we want to capture.\n",
