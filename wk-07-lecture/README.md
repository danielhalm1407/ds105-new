### Summary of the project:

I scraped each theme from the synopsis of each episode in easch season of the series Game of Thrones from the Fandom Wiki.

From this, I created a dataframe where each row is an occurence of the theme/character, and in turn, used that data to see:
* Which characters occur most often - the top 10.
* In what episodes of what seasons do they appear most frequently.
* What are the trends of their appearances.
* Which characters appear together and not together most often, and compare their episode appearances and trends.

# Generative AI acknowledgment.

In compliance with the DS105W ðŸ¤– [Generative AI Policy](https://lse-dsi.github.io/DS105/2023/winter-term/generative-ai.html), I declare that...

I have used the chatbot ChatGPT 3.5 from OpenAI to assist with this project, as can be seen from the chat log at [Summarise DS105 Requests](https://chat.openai.com/share/3a5b1540-8807-4282-b42e-6af860818051):

#### I have used it for the purposes of:

* Recalling commands, functions and arguments individually.
* Helping to improve functionality of my code/efficiency.
* Cleaning bugs/fixing errors.
* Typing out repetitive lines of code or for loops that would have taken me longer to type out.
* Building the workflow of the project and assisting with completing almost every one of the tasks:
    * I had to make corrections for:
        * Excessive code that was unnecessary for the tasks at hand.
        * Urls only having the partial and not full url path being scraped.
        * Often I would identify an error or correction and ask the chatbot to make said corrections.
        * Looking at the inspect element html code to see what the division, header or paragraph classes were, where there were line breaks or in general, how to scrape specific elements in the context of the webpages I was scraping. You will se evidence of this in the chatlog.
        * Misunderstanding of the requirements
